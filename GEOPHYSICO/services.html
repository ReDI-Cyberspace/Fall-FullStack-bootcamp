                        <p>
                            Seismic reflection is a geophysical technique for imaging the stratigraphic boundaries and geologic structure (such as faults, stratigraphic layering and folding) at depths between tens of meters and kilometers. Seismic energy is generated on the earth's surface, travels through sediment and rock, bounces back off of boundaries with differing rock densities, and is detected by geophones at specific separations from the source. The design of a survey includes many settings like geophone spacing and locations, energy source type and power and frequency, 'shot' locations and choice of recording seismograph. The  data is processed using a variety of methods to create a two-dimensional cross section of the subsurface.

                        <p>
                            Acoustic sub-bottom profiling (SBP) systems are used to determine physical properties of the sea floor and to image and characterize geological information from a few meters to tens of meters below the sea floor. Sub-bottom profilers typically consist of a single channel source that emits sound pulses into the shallow sediments of the subsea floor. The source frequency determines the image resolution and penetration depth, and scattering further limits them in coarse sediment or highly compacted sands. Due to changes in acoustic impedance (hardness), sound pulses reflect off the sea floor and underlying buried sediment layers. The different times taken for this signal to be returned and recorded by the SBP indicate how deep the layers are below the sea floor.

                        <p>
                            Seismic refraction is a geophysical technique for identifying the seismic compression-wave (P-wave) velocity structure of the subsurface. Seismic P-waves are created on the ground, travel through the soil and rock, and are picked up by geophones at specific distances from the source. P-waves, the fastest component of the seismic wave, are the first energy to arrive at each geophone (either direct or refracted). In order to determine the subsurface seismic P-wave velocities, the travel times of the first arriving energy are first recorded by a seismograph. The data are utilized to create a 2D P-wave velocity cross-section using a tomographic inversion.

                        <p>
                            Multi-channel Analysis of Surface Waves (MASW) is a seismic method that uses the dispersive characteristics of surface waves to determine the variation of shear-wave (S-wave) velocity with depth. Shear-wave velocity depends on the elastic properties of the rock and soil and is inversely proportional to the materials' stiffness and hardness. This technique is particularly helpful for pinpointing velocity inversions that other seismic techniques struggle with, such as soft soil zones beneath stiff or cemented soil or weathered bedrock beneath more competent bedrock.

                        <p>
                            Electrical resistivity imaging is used to obtain a two-dimensional (2D) cross-section of electrical resistivity, which depends on the kind of soil and rock, its porosity, its permeability, and the makeup of the fluids that fill the pore spaces. If there is a strong enough resistivity contrast, stratigraphic layers and anomalous zones can be located using the data. For instance, compared to sand and gravel layers, clay layers often have a substantially lower electrical resistance. A number of electrodes are contacted with the soil or rock to determine electrical resistance. Between one set of electrodes, a current is introduced while the voltage across the other set of electrodes is gauged. A 2D resistivity model can be created from a dense dataset produced by serious of measurements using various arrangements of electrode spacings.

                        <p>
                            Ground penetrating radar (GPR) uses high-frequency pulsed electromagnetic waves to map the subsurface. With GPR, transmitting and receiving antennas are dragged along the surface. The transmitting antenna sends short bursts of high-frequency radio waves into the earth. The wave spreads out and propagates downward. When a buried object or a boundary with different electrical characteristics is encountered, the receiving antenna records variations in the reflected return signal.

                        <p>
                            In order to map the seafloor and detect objects in the water column or along the bottom, active sonar systems like multi-beam bathymetric sonar are utilized. Typically, a multi-beam array is mounted directly to the hull of the ship. This device emits a fan-shaped pattern of multiple, simultaneous sonar beams (or sound waves) at once. This covers the area under the ship as well as the areas on each side. Seafloor depth and backscatter are two different types of data that multi-beam gathers. The time it takes for the sound to leave the array, hit the seafloor, and return to the array is used to calculate the depth of the seafloor, or bathymetry. In order to convert the two-way travel time from the ship to the seafloor and back as a depth measurement, surveyors on board the ship measure the speed of sound in the water where they are surveying. Backscatter is a measurement of the intensity of the sound echo that reflects back to the multibeam array. Backscatter data can provide information about the geological makeup of the seafloor or objects on it. For example, hard, rocky materials will generally reflect more sound than a softer material like mud.

                        <h3>SIDE-SCAN SONAR</h3>
                        <p>
                            Side-scan sonar is a type of active sonar system. Multiple sonar sensors, collectively referred to as a transducer array, transmit and receive the sound pulses that help mapping the seafloor or identifying other objects on the bottom. This array can be mounted to the hull of the ship or used as a towfish. When the ship moves at constant speeds and in straight lines, signals are sent from both sides of the transducer array, which sweeps the bottom like the fan-shaped beam of a flashlight. This allows the side-scan to map the seafloor Depending on the survey objectives, the tow-fish will record data at various sound frequencies. A lower frequency (50 to 100 kHz) can cover a broad portion of the bottom at low image resolution. Pulses at higher frequencies (500 kHz to 1 mHz) capture smaller areas with high resolutioninformation. Side-scan sonar data produces an "image" that is divided into dark and light regions. A dark region is produced by the powerful echo sent by the bottom-projecting hard objects. Weaker echoes are sent by shadows and soft surfaces like mud and sand, which produce bright regions.

                            A gravity survey measures changes in the Earth's gravity caused by variations in the subsurface's density. Microgravity refers to a highly accurate measurement and interpretation of very small variations in the Earth's gravity field and used when the near-surface futures are of interest. These could include karst features (caves, conduits, dissolution zones), hidden channels, tunnels, lateral changes in soil or rock density, large fractures, mines and geologic hazards. Measurements taken in a survey grid or along survey lines to produce plan-view contour maps that display lateral trends and direct confirmatory borings.

                            Metals (both ferrous and non-ferrous), inorganic pollutants, and changes in electrical conductivity are all detected using electromagnetic (EM) measurements. They are an effective means to non-invasively identify and map the lateral borders of metallic features, landfills, and inorganic pollution plumes. EM measurements are carried out with the aid of portable or towed equipment along survey lines or inside survey grids. The data is gathered digitally, and the borders of anomalous features can be seen by contouring the data on a plan-view map. Then, further geophysical methods, borings, or trenches can be employed to assess the anomalies.
