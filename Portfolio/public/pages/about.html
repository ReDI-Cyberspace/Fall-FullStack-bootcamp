                    >I am a driven and highly motivated Developer with a strong
                    foundation in IT Project Management. My journey into the
                    world of programming commenced in 2021 when I embarked on a
                    career with the IOTA Foundation. During my tenure with the
                    IOTA Foundation, I gained hands-on experience with a variety
                    of backend technologies, including NestJS and
                    NodeJs/Express. Additionally, I had the opportunity to
                    explore Svelte, further expanding my skill set.
                    <br />
                    Subsequently, I expanded my horizons while working at MOWEA
                    GmbH, where I contributed as a proficient web developer and
                    DevOps engineer. During this tenure, I gained valuable
                    expertise in UNIX systems, with a focus on Ubuntu and
                    Raspbian.
                    <br />
                    Currently, I am channeling my energy towards front-end
                    development, as I have discovered a deep passion for this
                    aspect of software engineering. I particularly relish the
                    challenges and creativity associated with working on the
                    React framework.
                    <br />
                    My approach to projects is characterized by open-mindedness,
                    creativity, and strong communication skills. I thrive in
                    diverse and dynamic work environments, where I can
                    effectively leverage my unique blend of skills and
                    experiences.
                    <br />
                    In addition to my technical skills, I am fluent in both my
                    native Polish and English, enabling me to collaborate and
                    communicate seamlessly in multicultural settings.
