You will also use Bootstrap that we just learned to add more colour and your personal style to the project.

    Understand and practice the use of tables in HTML.
    Understand and practice the use of carousels.

    CSS basic styling and responsiveness.
    Bootstrap.

Instructions:

Functionality:

    Create a page that will contain a gallery of your products.
    Create a new folder/directory (use a descriptive name for this folder, related to what content is inside).
    Inside this folder create a new HTML file (index.html).
    Use tables to display product/project information such as name, description, material, etc.
    Include images for each product to represent them visually.
    Create a ‚Äústyle.css‚Äù file and link to the HTML document for the product gallery.

Implement pagination to navigate between the homepage and product gallery page:

    Create a link on your project‚Äôs homepage to the new gallery page. The tag that holds the link can be a new button, a carousel, a link, etc (tip: check the correct path of the document you want to link).

Styles:

    Apply a font family to your project (for consistency, usually projects use one font family for the entire project, for this use the body {} in CSS).
    Apply font size and weight to all your project‚Äôs texts:
    Titles, texts, links, buttons...

Let‚Äôs use Bootstrap to style your webpage.

    Create a carousel on your homepage to show a preview of products/projects that are contained in your gallery page.
    Use Bootstrap and grid layout system to make your project responsive to your new page.
    Adapt the sizes to different screen sizes (as we know, laptops, tablets, and mobiles have different screen sizes, and as soon the size is changed the positions and proportions should be adapted): margin, padding, border, element‚Äôs position, etc.

Add styles to the tables on your product gallery.Add styles to the buttons respectively for their functionality (ex: cancel or delete buttons usually have the background colour red)
