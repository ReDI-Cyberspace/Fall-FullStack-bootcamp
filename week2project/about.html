        E-Scooters land in Bochum since Summer 2019. Accidents involved E-Scooters have increased significantly ever since.<br>
        Although there are regulations, such as no rides on footpath. But in reality most riders are not following.<br>
        Me personlly got hit by a E-Scooter, whose rider lose control of it and caused my injuries.<br>
        The rider ran after with his gang after hitting me. And the police never get further information.<br>
        Here I want to question the application of privacy regulations.<br>
        The <strong>GPS data</strong> acquired and stroed at the E-Scooter providers can be used to help police finding their stolen Scooters.<br>
        When a person was hurt by their Scooters and did not see those small place numbers, they refuse to provide these data.<br>
        <em>How is this fair? If the government is not ready to take actions to E-Scooter hitters. Then why are you approving the E-Scooter projects?</em>
